Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to replace the inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School, keep the rest of the data intact and perform analysis as executed in the current module. Metrics used to analyze the data involves: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

Results
Most of the metrics from the original analysis remain unchanged. This is understandable given that we had a large set of data, and cutting a small portion of the data (math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School) would not drastically skew the data. See below table from the original analysis, including math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School.





Table below is from the most recent analysis, where the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School are removed. Based on the table, the major difference is the averages and percent passing at Thomas High School. Even with the removal of certain data, the overall results remained fairly the same.




Summary

Four major changes occurred which includes, the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. Removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. And since the population amount was reduced, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages. Since these scores and percentage changes were minimal, we can assume that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.
